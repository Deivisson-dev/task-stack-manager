## StackTaskManager: A Stack-Based Task Management System

Welcome to `StackTaskManager` – a minimalist task management tool built to demonstrate the practical application of stack data structures in real-world software development. This project was developed as part of a Data Structures course, aiming to illustrate the fundamental operations of stacks, such as push, pop, and peek, through the lens of task management.

### Project Overview

`StackTaskManager` offers a simple yet effective way to manage your daily tasks. Utilizing the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle inherent to stacks, this application allows users to add, view, and remove tasks in a way that ensures the most recently added task is always addressed first. Whether you're juggling school assignments, work projects, or personal chores, `StackTaskManager` helps keep your priorities in check.

### Features

- **Add Tasks**: Insert tasks to your stack with ease, each new task placed atop the previous.
- **Conclude Tasks**: Remove the most recent task from your stack, symbolizing its completion.
- **View Pending Tasks**: Display all tasks currently in your stack, starting with the most recent.
- **Clear Screen Utility**: Keeps the interface clean and user-friendly with each action.
- **Custom ANSI Color Coding**: Enhances readability and user interaction with colorful console output.

### Technologies

- **Python**: Chosen for its simplicity and readability, making the project easily approachable for beginners in programming and data structures.
- **ANSI Color Codes**: For a touch of visual organization and appeal in the terminal.

### Usage

Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the script using Python:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StackTaskManager.git
cd StackTaskManager
python stack_task_manager.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to manage your tasks.

### Educational Value

This project serves as a hands-on exercise for students and enthusiasts looking to deepen their understanding of stack data structures and their applications. By implementing a stack from scratch and using it in a real-world scenario, learners can appreciate both the theoretical and practical aspects of this fundamental data structure.

### Contribution
